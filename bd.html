          You've been my guiding light, my source of comfort, and my greatest inspiration. Your love knows no bounds, and your kindness touches the hearts of everyone around you. Your selflessness and generosity are qualities I aspire to embody every day.
          
          On your birthday, I want you to know how cherished and loved you truly are. Your presence in my life brings immeasurable joy and warmth, and I am endlessly grateful to call you my mom.
          
          May this day be filled with laughter, love, and unforgettable moments that bring a smile to your face. Here's to another year of happiness, blessings, and beautiful memories shared together.
          
          Happy birthday, Mom! Thank you for being the extraordinary woman you are.
